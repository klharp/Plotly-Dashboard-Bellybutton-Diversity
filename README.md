# Plot.ly Homework - Belly Button Biodiversity

Built an interactive dashboard to explore the [Belly Button Biodiversity dataset](http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/), which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.

D3, Plotly, Javascript, HTML, and CSS were used in this exercise.

The final app can be viewed at: <--add web site here when done-->
